# Audio Visualizations

This repository hosts multiple projects for audio‑driven visuals.

## What’s inside
- Blender projects for rendered visuals.
- Planned Unity and Unreal Engine projects for live visuals.

## Notes
Audio assets are ignored by default in .gitignore and should be added manually when needed.

# Blender Projects
Quick Setup Notes:
- Check sampling (objects, Geometry Nodes, simulations) and set “Sound to Samples” in Graph Editor → Channel.
- Add the audio file in Video Editing to hear it.
- Start sampling at frame 1.
